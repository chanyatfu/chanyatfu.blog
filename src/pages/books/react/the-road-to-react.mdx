**Website**: [The Road to React: The React.js with Hooks in JavaScript Book](https://www.roadtoreact.com)\
**Author**: Robin Wieruch

The books cover the fundamentals and the intermediate topics of React. It is a more comprehensive book than [React Key Concepts](/books/react/react-key-concepts). I would recommend this book if you already have some experience with React and want to learn more about it.
