## What is memorization?

Memorization is a technique that allows you to store the results of something. That something can be a function reference, a result returned by a function, or an element.

## Why use memorization?
The largest motivation for using memorization is to avoid repeating expensive operations. For example, a fucntion that takes a long time to execute, or a component that takes a long time to render. This also included prevent re-rendering in React, as you might remenber from the previous chapter that React decides if the nested components would need to re-render or not by comparing the reference values return by its render function.
