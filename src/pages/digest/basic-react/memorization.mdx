## What is memorization?

Memorization is a technique that allows you to store the results of something. That something can be a function reference, a result returned by a function, or an element.

## Why use memorization?
The largest motivation for using memorization is to avoid repeating expensive operations. For example, a fucntion that takes a long time to execute, or a component that takes a long time to render. This also included prevent re-rendering in React, as you might remenber from the previous chapter that React decides if the nested components would need to re-render or not by comparing the reference values return by its render function.

## `useCallback` and `useMemo`

`useMemo` and `useCallback` are similar to `useEffect` in some sense. You define some dependencies to determine how to hooks react to it.

`useCallback` received two arugments - a function and an array of dependencies, and return a memorized version of the function. The function will only be re-created if one of the dependencies has changed. The way it works can be illustrated by the following code.

```ts
let oldFunction = null;

function useCallback(fn: Function, deps: Array<any>) {
  deps.foreach(dep => {
    if (dep.hasChanged) {
      oldFunction = fn;
    }
  })
  return oldFunction;
}
```
