## Overview
This chapter summarize the common syntactic sugar you might encounter in React, and their underlying implementation.

## Why should I care about this?
The syntax sugar in React abstracts away the underlying implementation, which is great for daily development. But it also makes it harder in understanding the principle and implementaion in React.

## JSX
React component return JSX, which might looks something like this:
```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <main className="hello">
      <Welcome>Welcome to demistify.react</Welcome>
      This is the first chapter.
    </main>
  )
}
```

JSX is a syntax sugar for `React.createElement(type, props, ...children)`, which return a JavaScript object. The above JSX is equivalent to:
```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return createElement(
    'main',
    { className: 'hello' },
    createElement(Welcome, null, 'Welcome to demistify.react'),
    'This is the first chapter.'
  )
}
```


## The `children` prop
Sometimes you might want to pass children to a component like this:
```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <Outer>
      <Inner />
    </Outer>
  )
}
```

The above JSX is equivalent to:
```tsx
const Component = () => {
  return (
    <Outer children={<Inner />} />
  )
}
```

The `children` prop works just like other prop. The only difference is that React provide an alternative way for writing it.
